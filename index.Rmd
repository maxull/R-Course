# **R-Course by: Max Ullrich**

In this course we will go through all things R and RStudio, so that you will be able to do everything from simple statistical tests to handling big data, doing methylation analysis and possibly even some machine learning/AI.

## How to get started

1. fork the repo for this website and follow instructions on read me to get set up. [https://github.com/CrumpLab/LabJournalWebsite](https://github.com/CrumpLab/LabJournalWebsite)

2. Blog/journal what you are doing in R, by editing the Journal.Rmd. See the [Journal page](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/Journal.html) for an example of what to do to get started learning R.

3. See the [links page](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/Links.html) for lots of helpful links on learning R.

4. Change everything to make it your own.
